I am exited to tell you more about this website.so when i was a kid <i>(i still am)</i> i started to <strong>learn how to program</strong> it. I had <strong>the best teacher</strong>like no joke, he was<i>soo cool</i> whenever i asked a question he would  pay full attention to me like he had to to it like he was required to do it. And thats what makes my programing teacher <strong>DA BEST</strong></p>

                    <br>
                    <p>ok so i know this is suposed to be a teniss blog but i dont really know <strong>that much </strong>of teniss because i started to play teniss as a sport when i was only <strong>four years old </strong>. so i uhh, know a bit about teniss- you have to <sttrong>concentrate at all times</sttrong> to be the best and you also have to move with your legs like alot. like alot, alot. and by that i meen you need lots of leg power- you need to move around with your legs more than you arms or your brain.</p>
